    "Des1":"A hash function is like a deterministic fingerprint of a piece of arbitrary data. It is very easy to compute but very hard to reverse.",

    "Key Pair" :"Key Pair",
    "Des2":"A private key is used to derive a public key which acts as your public address. Then, you can sign messages with your private key and anyone else can cryptographically prove that your key pair signed the message.",
